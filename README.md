# Word Vector Models for Gulf History using the India Office Records

This repo contains four word vector models trained using the [WordVectors](https://rdrr.io/github/bmschmidt/wordVectors/man/train_word2vec.html) package in R for selected documents in File 5 Slave Trade (IOR/R/15/1/199-234) from the India Office Records (IOR). 

The corpus was created in March 2024 using the Text Titan super model in Transkribus. This corpus creation and WVM training were done by David Wrisley and Suphan Kirmizialtin. 

Details of the four models are found in a csv file in this repo. The documents from the QDL used to build the corpus are found in a csv file in this repo. 

Notebooks for querying these models can be found [here](https://github.com/NEU-DSG/wwp-public-code-share/tree/main/WordVectors).
